# Kotlin Cached Property 
Lazy cache using Kotlin delegated property.


```kotlin
class SomeClass {

    val myData by cached { Random(10).nextInt() }

    // Clears cached value and makes the `cached`
    // initializer block run again on next `myData` request
    fun revoke() = ::myData.invalidateCache()
}
```
